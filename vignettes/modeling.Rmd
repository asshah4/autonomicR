In both epidemiology and clinical research, particularly for grants and major projects, specific aims are created. Each aim has hypotheses associated with it that are eventually tested. These are all pre-specified, which gives weight/importance to negative findings at times.

In the `card` package, there is a series of functions to help simplify the research process. It's based on the `tidymodels` approach, using the multiple pre-specified models from `parsnip` to create effective workflows. 

```{r setup}
library(card)
data(geh)

# Formula
f <- svg_mag + qrs_tang ~ lab_hba1c + age + sex + bmi + cad + htn
```
