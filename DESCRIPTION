Description: This package contains tools needed for the management of
		data that has been collected to study autonomic physiology, 
		particularly of how the autnomic nervous system effects the 
		cardiovascular system (neurocardiology). The package uses tools
		built to study electrocardiographic time series data, focused on
		heart rate variability and morphology in companionship with MATLAB.
		It also helps with the management of extended time series, such as
		longitudinal data and recurrent events. It also contains methods
		for analyzing and studying circadian events.
