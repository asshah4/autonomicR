# __card__

## Cardiovascular and Autonomic Research Design

The goal of __card__ is to create functions and analytical approaches in neurocardiology, with a focus on electrocardiogram data and epidemiological concepts. An important engine within this ecosystem are the circadian analysis tools.

## Installation

Once published, you can install the released version of __card__ from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
#install.packages("card")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asshah4/card")
```

## Usage

This package is intended for analyzing cardiovascular signals and autonomic physiology. For example, __card__ can provide an analysis that detects circadian rhythmicity of a regression.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cosinor-building-curves.jpeg")
```
