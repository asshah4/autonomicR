# __card__

When conducting research, its invaluable to have readily used functions and patterns at hand, forcing you to format and manage a data workflow similarly. Thus, all that is needed is a `library(card)`.  

## Cardiovascular and Autonomic Research Design

The goal of `card` is to create functions and analytical approaches in neurocardiology, with a focus on electrocardiogram data and epidemiological concepts. An important engine within this ecosystem are the circadian analysis tools. Its developed to fit a _tidy_ approach to statistical analysis.

The areas of focus of this package are the following:

- cardiovascular disease
- circadian rhythms
- electrocardiography (heart rate variability and morphology)
- signal processing

## Installation

Once published, you can install the released version of __card__ from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
#install.packages("card")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asshah4/card")
```

## Usage

This package is intended for analyzing cardiovascular signals and autonomic physiology. The current collection of functions are built practically around this paradigm. The current focus, in `card v0.1.0` is the development of a flexible and tidy analytical approach to circadian rhythms. 

### Cosinor Analysis

Here is an example of the process of fitting a cosinor model to time-series data.

```{r}
library(card)
data(twins)
m <- cosinor(rDYX ~ hour, twins, tau = 24)
summary(m)
ggcosinor(m)
```
