# **card**

## Cardiovascular and Autonomic Research Design

The goal of **card** is to create functions and analytical approaches in
neurocardiology, with a focus on electrocardiogram data and
epidemiological concepts. An important engine within this ecosystem are
the circadian analysis tools.

## Installation

Once published, you can install the released version of **card** from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#install.packages("card")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asshah4/card")
#> Skipping install of 'card' from a github remote, the SHA1 (298cbf54) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

## Usage

This package is intended for analyzing cardiovascular signals and
autonomic physiology. For example, **card** can provide an analysis that
detects circadian rhythmicity of a regression.

``` r
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/cosinor-building-curves.jpeg")
```
